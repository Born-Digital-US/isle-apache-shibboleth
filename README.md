## Loading the ISLE.localdomain Islandora instance ('quickstart')

* To install the current version of Islandora along with a local Drupal website...
  * `docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh`

## Environmental Variables Available

* `ISLANDORA_UID = 1000` (default)
  * Match the Islandora UID to the user id of the user on the host system responsible for Islandora's webroot.
  * Most distros use UID 1000 for the primary user, so it is the default.
  * **If you are experiencing permission issues on the host when editing your webroot `id -u` to get the appropriate UID to set.**

* `ENABLE_XDEBUG = false` (default) | true
  * Enables the XDEBUG Apache mod for remote debugging.

* `PULL_ISLE_BUILD_TOOLS = true` (default) | false
  * Fetches the latest ISLE build tools from the [Islandora Collaboration Group](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/isle_drupal_build_tools)
